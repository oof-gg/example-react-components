# Example Animations using GSAP
This repository contains examples of animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work in every major browser. It is a suite of tools for scripted, high-performance HTML5 animations that work in all major browsers. No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 4 million sites.
